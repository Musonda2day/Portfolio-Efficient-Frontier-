# Portfolio-Efficient-Frontier-
Construction of an efficient frontier of a two-asset portfolio 

We present construction of an efficient frontier of a two asset portfolio. We will build an efficient frontier for different weights of two exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track the S&P 500 Index. From the constructed efficient frontier we then proceed to select a portfolio weight combination based on the returns and risk requirements.

The one year closing prices of the two ETFs; XLI and XLE is used in our analysis.
