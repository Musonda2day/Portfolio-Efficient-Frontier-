# Portfolio-Efficient-Frontier-

Investors often aim at maximizing returns on investment for a given level of risk. This can be achieved by selecting a number of assets in which to invest in so as to minimize the risk and at the same time maximize the returns on investment. An efficient frontier represents a set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected returns for a defined level of risk (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientfrontier.asp).

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to construct an efficient portfolio of a two-asset portfolio bnased on the different weight combimnations of the assets. The assets we will use for this demonstration are two S&P 500 Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) of XLE and XLI. . We then proceed to select a suitable portfolio combination on the efficient frontier based on the risk tolerance and the required expected returns.
